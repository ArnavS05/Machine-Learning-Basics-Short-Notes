# Machine-Learning-Basics-Short-Notes
This is a set of concise notes for people who have just stepped into the world of Deep Learning or Machine Learning.
This covers the basic idea behind ML.
I have created this using the content of the videos of the first course in the Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI.
I have added the content in the way I understood the concepts. The text has been supported by screenshots of some slides shown in the afore mentioned videos.
